# SureBuy smart contracts
The project's smart contracts are deployed on the Sepolia testnet and consist of two primary components: SureBuy and SureBuyMP. The SureBuy smart contract serves as a bridge between vendors and manufacturers, enabling them to register on the platform. Vendors can send requests for attestation to manufacturers, who can then accept or decline these requests. Additionally, SureBuy interacts with the Sign Protocol smart contract on Sepolia to facilitate secure attestations. The SureBuyMP contract functions as the marketplace interface, connecting verified vendors with buyers. Only vendors who have received attestation from manufacturers are permitted to sell their products in the marketplace, ensuring that all items available for purchase are legitimate.
